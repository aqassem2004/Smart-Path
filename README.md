# Smart Path Using BFS in C
This project is a pathfinding algorithm that allows users to input cities and the roads between them. The goal is to compute the shortest path between a starting city and a destination city using the <b>Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.</b> The challenge of this project lies in its implementation in C, where I focused on low-level techniques such as the use of pointers and creating a queue data structure using a linked list.

The program takes in a set of cities, represented by integers, and roads connecting them, and performs BFS to find the shortest path from a given source city to a target city. The BFS algorithm explores the cities level by level and guarantees finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, making it ideal for this use case.
